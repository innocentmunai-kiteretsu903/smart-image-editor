## Group members

## Major changes from previous submission
We have talked about our idea and plan with Karly. Based on the discussion, we have decided to make a GUI for the user to edit pictures with some machine learning-powered capability (if possible). For the GUI, we plan to empower the 

## introduction
Bozen and I are planning to create a picture editor with a GUI.

Generally, we plan to provide the following features (may not include all of them):

**Basic adjustment**
1. Brightness
2. Contrast
3. Saturation
4. Crop
5. Rotate

**Filter**
e.g. Black and while; blurred...

**Machine learning**
e.g enlarge the picture while preseving the quality

**Encryption and sharing**
Encrypt the output image; share by email.

## The libries needed
1. Tkinter. to create the GUI.
2. Pillow. the library for basic adjustment of pictures
3. opencv (cv2). the library that provides the machine learning capability to process pictures
4. Numpy, scipy. the library that provides the computational capability to process the data extracted from pictures
5. Crypto, binascii. for encryption

## timeline
April 24 - 27: learn libraries
April 28 - 30: finish the first version
May 1 - 3 : Discuss with Karly and start improvements (if any)
