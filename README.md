# cs32-final-project
Final project for Harvard's CS32

## Group members
1. Bozen Peng
2. Innocent Munai

## Major changes from previous submission
We have talked about our idea and plan with our assigned TF, Karly. Based on the discussion, we have decided to make a GUI for the user to edit pictures with some machine learning-powered capability (if possible). 

## Introduction
We are planning to create a photo editor with a GUI.

Generally, we plan to provide the following features (may not include all of them depending on how complex we'll find the implementation):

**Basic adjustment**  
1. Brightness
2. Contrast
3. Saturation
4. Crop
5. Rotate

**Filter**  
e.g. Black and while; Smooth; Sharpen; Blurred ; ...

**Machine learning**  
e.g Enlarge and/or Compressing the photo while preseving the quality

**Encryption and sharing**  
Encrypting the output image; sharing by email.

## The libries needed
1. Tkinter:  To create the GUI.
2. Pillow: The library for basic adjustment of pictures
3. opencv (cv2): The library that provides the machine learning capability to process pictures
4. Numpy, scipy: The library that provides the computational capability to process the data extracted from pictures
5. Crypto, binascii: For encryption

## Timeline
April 24 - 27: learning libraries  
April 28 - 30: finishing the first version  
May 1 - 3 : Discuss with Karly and start improvements (if any)  
May 3: Submission

## Current progress
What we have accomplished:
1. Major changes compared to previous submission
2. Played with the libraries needed; generally determined what we need
3. Individually tested on demo functions for some of the image processing features
4. Found the resources to learn the libraries sufficiently for our project
