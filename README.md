# cs32-final-project
Final project for Harvard's CS32

## Group members
1. Bozen Peng
2. Innocent Munai

## Our Plan
Bozen and I are planning to provide a user interface (maybe a Python-based web application) for users to input an image of low quality and output a restored, clear image by employing several machine learning image restoration algorithms. We intend to input this image into several models that we initially trained and we will output all processed images. The user will then be able to decide which one they want.
